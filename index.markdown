# About Me

I am an AI4Code research fellow at Microsoft Research, where I work with Sriram Rajamani, Aditya Kanade and Nagarajan Natarajan. I recieved my Bachelors of Technology in CSE from IIT Delhi in 2023. I have also worked with Prof. Sorav Bansal during my BTP.

I am currently working on AI Code Agents, AI based code generation, program synthesis and everything AI4Code. I hope to explore and learn more about Large Language Models (LLMs) and how they work in the field of Code and Programming Languages. 

I am looking to apply for PhD's this year (2024) for joining in 2025.
